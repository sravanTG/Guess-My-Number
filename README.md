# Guess-My-Number

concept of the game.

every time you open the game, the computer is gonna generate itself a random number from 1 - 20.
your job is to guess the number in as fewer tries as possible.
for every wrong guess 1 point is deducted(subtracted) from the initial score of 20.

try to achieve the highest score possible.
if the initial score(20) becomes 0, then you are lost.
i tried to use as less colors as possible. but you can play around with the css part and add your own colors to the code.
i am still learning web designing and am improving myself.

I HOPE YOU ALL LIKE iT.
